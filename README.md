# SpringProjectOld
- An old version of a group project done with Wiley Edge, missing features and Junit tests due to the original Git account being deleted.
- This project serves as a good starting example of building a Spring Boot REST API for other projects, as well as showcasing how I like to structure my code.

# What I did:
- Primarily I did the REST API parts, for example the Controllers, DAOs, DTOs, Entities, exception and Service layers. The front end was primarily done by a team mate and is an old version, and the testing and database was also done by a different team mate on a branch that I don't have access too.

# What needs updating:
- The Mappers need implemented, at the moment the entity is essentially working as a DTO/ mapper but this isn't a fantastic way of doing this.
